# Covid-19 Tracker
Inspiration taken from a youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF3pIMJUZxM&t=705s][tutorial] and edited for personal preference

All Data used comes from the [https://disease.sh/][disease.sh] API

## Notable Additions / Changes:
Added Typescript
Added data per Million counts
Separate Tabs for different graphs/maps for better readability
Created new Map Component from scratch for total and per million data
Don't know where a country is? No problem, the maps now center on the selected country
Added / Removed some styling based on personal preference
